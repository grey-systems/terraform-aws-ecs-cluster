# terraform-ecs-cluster

This repo contains a [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) module to create an Amazon ECS Cluster.

* Creates the cluster
* Creates n-instances and attach them to the cluster
* Create the required IAM roles, required for ECS Services.


Module usage:

      provider "aws" {
        access_key = "${var.access_key}"
        secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
        region     = "us-east-1"
      }

    module "ecs-cluster" {
        source                = "github.com/grey-systems/terraform-ecs-cluster.git?ref=master"
        environment           = "${var.environment}"
        name                  = "cluster-name"
        instance_keypair_name = "${var.keypair_name}"

        # use of github.com/grey-systems/terraform-multitier-vpc for create an VPC
        vpc_subnet_ids        = ["${split(",", module.vpc_network.private_subnets_ids)}"]
        instances             = ["${var.ecs_instances}"]
    }


Inputs
---------

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
