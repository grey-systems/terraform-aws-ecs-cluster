# terraform-ecs-cluster

This repo contains a [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) module for
provisioning an [AWS Multitier VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario3.html), with the following topology:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR (example: 10.0.0.0/16). This provides 65,536 private IPv4 addresses.
* 1-n private subnets (spread between the different AZ).
* 1-n public subnets (spread between the different AZ).
* VPN Connection between your VPC and your network. The VPN connection consists of a virtual private gateway located on the Amazon side of the VPN connection and a customer gateway located on your side of the VPN connection.


Module usage:

      provider "aws" {
        access_key = "${var.access_key}"
        secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
        region     = "us-east-1"
      }

     module "vpc-custom" {
       source = "github.com/grey-systems/terraform-ecs-cluster.git?ref=master"

       availability_zones = "us-east-1a,us-east-1b"
       cidr_block = "10.2.0.0/16"
       public_cidr_blocks = "10.2.0.0/24,10.2.0.1/24"
       private_cidr_blocks = "10.2.128.0/24,10.0.2.129.0/24"
       environment = "testing"
       short_identifier = "test"
       # It should be your firewall public IP
       customer_gateway_ip = "92.18.128.4"
       customer_gateway_name = "my-testing-hq-gateway"
       subnets_vpn = "192.168.0.0/24"
     }
